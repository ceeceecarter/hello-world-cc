hello-world project of cc

Hello world!
My name is Ceecee and I'm .Net Developer. I have a 7-month-old yorkiepoo puppy.
I've tried the Wim Hof breathing exercise and I was able to hold my breath for 2 mins!
I'm starting to eat more vegetables and less and less meat. 
I consider myself sea-gan because I still eat seafood.

I want my projects in GitHub 
so that I can exchange ideas and collaborate with other developers.
